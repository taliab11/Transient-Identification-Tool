# Transient-Identification-Tool

## Overview
This repository contains a tool for identification of transients, pulse and temporary changes, over time.  
Although this tool was originally designed for Biology research and specifically for gene-expression analysis, it can be relevant and implemented in many other fields. 

## What is a Transient?
According to its [dictionary definition](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/transient), a "Transient" is something that lasts for only a short time, temporary.
In Biology, there are many transient processes, including those that accure during cell state transition and aqcuire transient changes in gene expression. Identification of genes that change transiently during these different processes, can help us better understand their role and effect on the cell.

## What are the optional methods and what are their differences?
The tool, and both of the optional methods within it, are based on alignment of the "transient candidate" with a linear line connecting its two ends. The rationale is that the less the linear alignment is "successful", the probability of the candidate of being transient arises.
